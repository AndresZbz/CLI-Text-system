# CLI Text system

Simple try of a C++ CLI text system.

To read texts you need a csv file where in the A column you can write the text you want in any row, then when you call the function write the row of the text you wanna display.

It's not perfect but it works xD.

## Running it

You will need a C++ compiler, in my case I use g++. then use
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

after compiling it just use ```./main```
